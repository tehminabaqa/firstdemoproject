Basic Local Repositery Workflow:

make directory for keeping repos
Make further folder for keeping your work rep separate
go into directory into terminal
initialize repos in this dir

1#git init	(this will crete hidden folder .git in your current workig directory)

Make some files .txt or etc 

check status
2#git status

add these files into staging area
3#git add ist.txtf or
#git add *.txt
#git add

commit these files 
4#git commit -m "your msg like updaitng login etc etc"

check log
5#git log

UnStaging Files:
#git reset 		(remove files from staging area) 
#git reset --hard 	(can remove changes in files if they are not committed



Ignoring Files:
make a file with extension .gitignore
then add file path name extension or directory in above file and save 


Brances Commands:in git brances are mandatory(master branch by default)
#git branch
#git branch -v
#git branch dev
#git checkout dev
#git merge dev
#git log dev master
#git log dev..master
#git log master..dev


Stasing:
#git stash			save local changes
#git stash save <name>		save local changes with name
#git stash list			show list of stashes 
#git stash pop	
#git stash apply stashname	remove from stash


For Making Remote Repositries:
#git push			push changes to remote repo
#git fetch			fetch changes from remote repo
#git merge			mrge changes that was fetched
#git pull			fetch and merge changes from remote repo
#git remote -v			shows remote urls(where is your local repo placed on remote repo)
#git remote show origin		shows details of origin
#git remote add reponame	add remote repo in local repo
